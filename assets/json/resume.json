        "Ongoing work on Synergistic Simplex system architecture that harnesses cooperation among safety- and mission-critical elements, as well as between perception and control modules, to enhance the safety and performance of autonomous ground and aerial vehicles.",
        "Devised Perception Simplex, a system architecture for autonomous vehicles that decouples mission and safety responsibilities, providing verifiable obstacle detection and deterministic collision avoidance within the operational design domain.",
        "Recognizing the lack of context-aware metrics for object detection in autonomous driving, created Risk Ranked Recall.",
        "Optimized security auditing for real-time applications, creating Ellipsis. Harnessing the inherent predictability of behaviors in real-time applications, Ellipsis all but eliminates the possibility of audit event loss during typical operation and significantly curtails auditing data volume (> 90%) while preserving security-relevant information.",
        "Introduced a new memory type, Inner Non-Cacheable, Outer Cacheable, empowering real-time applications to bypass cache coherence mechanisms and mitigate memory access latency variability selectively for shared data, with no impact on private data. Prototype implementation on Linux Kernel and Gem5 simulator, yielded 52% less worst-case latency and negligible impact on performance.",
        "Helped design security-aware task scheduling for real-time applications and input prioritization schemes for object detection DNN."
