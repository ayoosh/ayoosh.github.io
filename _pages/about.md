<div style="text-align: justify;">

The focus of my research is system architecture design,
  utilizing expertise across various components and layers within systems to
  foster collaborative integrations while prioritizing simplicity in design to create effective solutions.

<br> <br>

My research interests span functional safety, temporal safety, and security in cyber-physical and real-time systems.
Prior works
  architected frameworks for achieving <a href="/projects/av-safety/"> verifiable safety in autonomous vehicles</a>,
  mitigated <a href="/projects/inc-oc/"> execution time variability stemming from cache coherence mechanisms</a>,
  and
  enabled <a href="/projects/ellipsis/"> security auditing in real-time systems</a>.

<br>
<br>

I earned my PhD in CS at<a href="https://cs.illinois.edu/"> UIUC </a>,
advised by <a href="https://cs.illinois.edu/about/people/faculty/lrs">Prof. Lui Sha</a>,
MS in ECE at <a href="https://engineering.wisc.edu/departments/electrical-computer-engineering/">UWM</a>,
and BE Hons. EEE at <a href="https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/">BITS Pilani</a>.
In the past, I have worked at <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/">Nvidia</a>, addressing execution time variability, building pre-silicon test infrastructure, and developing kernel drivers for Tegra systems.
I also worked at <a href="https://www.netapp.com/">NetApp</a>, developing networked file systems.
