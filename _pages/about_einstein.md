I am passionate about crafting efficient systems to overcome complex challenges,
striving to unravel intricacies with elegantly simple solutions. 
My problem-solving methodology revolves around harnessing expertise across diverse layers within a system,
 fostering collaboration among components,
 and prioritizing simplicity in design.
This approach has empowered me to
  <a href="/projects/av-safety/"> architect frameworks for safe autonomous driving</a>,
  <a href="/projects/ellipsis/"> enable comprehensive security auditing for real-time systems</a>,
 and <a href="/projects/inc-oc/"> mitigate execution variability stemming from cache coherence mechanisms</a>.
