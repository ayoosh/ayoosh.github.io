  abstract  = {System auditing is an essential tool for detecting malicious events and conducting forensic analysis. Although used extensively on general-purpose systems, auditing frameworks have not been designed with consideration for the unique constraints and properties of Real-Time Systems (RTS). System auditing could provide tremendous benefits for security-critical RTS. However, a na\"{\i}ve deployment of auditing on RTS could violate the temporal requirements of the system while also rendering auditing incomplete and ineffectual. To ensure effective auditing that meets the computational needs of recording complete audit information while adhering to the temporal requirements of the RTS, it is essential to carefully integrate auditing into the real-time (RT) schedule. This work adapts the Linux Audit framework for use in RT Linux by leveraging the common properties of such systems, such as special purpose and predictability. Ellipsis, an efficient system for auditing RTS is devised that learns the expected benign behaviors of the system and generates succinct descriptions of the expected activity. Evaluations using varied RT applications show that Ellipsis reduces the volume of audit records generated during benign activity by up to 97.55\%, while recording detailed logs for suspicious activities. Empirical analyses establish that the auditing infrastructure adheres to the properties of predictability and isolation that are important to RTS. Furthermore, the schedulability of RT task sets under audit is comprehensively analyzed to enable the safe integration of auditing in RT task schedules.},

  abstract = {Advances in deep learning have revolutionized cyber-physical applications, including the development of autonomous vehicles. However, real-world collisions involving autonomous control of vehicles have raised significant safety concerns regarding the use of deep neural networks (DNNs) in safety-critical tasks, particularly perception. The inherent unverifiability of DNNs poses a key challenge in ensuring their safe and reliable operation. In this work, we propose perception simplex (PS), a fault-tolerant application architecture designed for obstacle detection and collision avoidance. We analyse an existing LiDAR-based classical obstacle detection algorithm to establish strict bounds on its capabilities and limitations. Such analysis and verification have not been possible for deep learning-based perception systems yet. By employing verifiable obstacle detection algorithms, PS identifies obstacle existence detection faults in the output of unverifiable DNN-based object detectors. When faults with potential collision risks are detected, appropriate corrective actions are initiated. Through extensive analysis and software-in-the-loop simulations, we demonstrate that PS provides deterministic fault tolerance against obstacle existence detection faults, establishing a robust safety guarantee.

  abstract = { Perception, Planning, and Control form the essential components of autonomy in advanced air mobility. This work advances the holistic integration of these components to enhance the performance and robustness of the complete cyber-physical system. We adapt Perception Simplex, a system for verifiable collision avoidance amidst obstacle detection faults, to the vertical landing maneuver for autonomous air mobility vehicles. We improve upon this system by replacing static assumptions of control capabilities with dynamic confirmation, i.e., real-time confirmation of control limitations of the system, ensuring reliable fulfillment of safety maneuvers and overrides, without dependence on overly pessimistic assumptions. Parameters defining control system capabilities and limitations, e.g., maximum deceleration, are continuously tracked within the system and used to make safety-critical decisions. We apply these techniques to propose a verifiable collision avoidance solution for autonomous aerial mobility vehicles operating in cluttered and potentially unsafe environments. },
